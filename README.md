## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Brainstorming & Design**  
   → Defined key features, sketched layout  
2. **Component Testing**  
   → Verified OLED, rotary, and touch input  
3. **Prototyping**  
   → Breadboard testing + wiring plan  
4. **Code Development**  
   → Arduino firmware + Python desktop script for data  
5. **3D Design & Print**  
   → Designed enclosure in CATIA V5  
6. **Assembly & Testing**  
   → Mounted components, debugged HID functions  
7. **Final Tuning**  
   → Key mappings, OLED layout, plug-and-play setup
